<h1>Description</h1>
"Codex Naturalis" is a strategic and tactical board game created by Thomas Dupont, published by Bombyx. It is suitable for 2-4 players and has a duration of about 20-30 minutes per game. Here is a detailed description of the game:

<h3>Setting</h3>
"Codex Naturalis" is set in a world where players take on the role of medieval monks creating an illustrated manuscript that describes all the natural wonders of the world. The goal is to build your own codex by adding pages that represent various creatures and plants in a way that maximizes victory points.

<h3>Game Components</h3>
Page Cards: These are the main cards that players will use to build their codex. Each card has various natural resource symbols (such as mushrooms, plants, insects, etc.).
Resource Cards: These cards show specific resource symbols that can be used to meet the requirements of the Page cards.
Tokens: Used to keep track of points and accumulated resources.
Personal Board: Each player has a personal playing area where they will place their Page cards.
Rulebook: The manual that explains the game rules.

<h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
The game is primarily based on card placement. Each turn, players can do one of the following actions:
Draw a card: Take a new Page or Resource card from the deck.
Play a card: Place a Page card on their personal board, respecting placement rules and resource requirements.
The cards must be placed so that at least one corner of the new card touches a corner of a card already placed on the personal board. Additionally, Page cards often require certain resources to be available on the personal board in order to be played.

<h3>Objective of the Game</h3>
The goal is to earn the most victory points by the end of the game. Points can be earned in several ways:

Personal Objectives: Each player has specific objectives that they can complete for bonus points.
Common Objectives: There are also common objectives visible to all players that can be completed for additional points.
Card Placement: Placing cards strategically to create combinations that generate points.
<h3>End of the Game</h3>
The game ends when one of the players reaches a certain end-game condition, such as exhausting the deck of Page cards or reaching a certain number of cards in their codex. At this point, the points are counted and the player with the highest score wins.
